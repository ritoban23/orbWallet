# Multi-Chain Wallet Generator

A React-based web wallet generator for **Ethereum** and **Solana** blockchains.  
Allows users to generate secure mnemonics, derive multiple wallets using standard HD paths, and manage wallets easily â€” all within a clean UI.

## Features

- Generate a new **mnemonic seed phrase** (BIP39 standard)
- Derive multiple wallets from a single mnemonic using HD derivation paths
- Support for both **Ethereum** (EVM) and **Solana** wallets
- View public addresses and private keys for each generated wallet
- Delete individual wallets or clear all wallets
- Switch between Ethereum and Solana wallet generation modes
- Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
